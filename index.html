        HI! My name is Noelani Ching. I am currently a Junior and a Student-athlete here at Concordia. <br> 
        I am studying Computer Science, but am interested in Behavorial Science aswell. 
        I play softball for Concordia and have been for the past three years. 
        After I graduate, I plan to find a job in the field I finalize my major in, therefore, I do not have anything set in stone yet. 
        A fun fact about me is I love Disneyland and Star Wars! My favorite era of Star Wars is the Prequel Trilogy. 
        I have an annual pass to Disneyland. Where I love to study or hangout during some free time outside of class and softball.
